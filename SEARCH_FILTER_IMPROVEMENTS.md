# Search & Filter Improvements Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the enhanced search and filtering capabilities implemented in the Memora memory assistant application. The improvements focus on better user experience, more accurate search results, and intelligent AI-powered suggestions.

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Search Functionality
- **AI-Powered Semantic Search**: Uses ChatGPT to understand context and meaning
- **Multi-Field Search**: Searches across content, summary, tags, and AI reasoning
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles typos and partial matches
- **Contextual Filtering**: Removes irrelevant results based on query context

### 2. Advanced Filtering
- **Memory Type Filtering**: Filter by appointment, task, reminder, etc.
- **Importance Filtering**: Filter by importance level (1-10)
- **Date-Based Filtering**: Filter by creation date
- **Combined Filters**: Use multiple filters simultaneously

### 3. Smart Sorting
- **Relevance Sorting**: AI-powered relevance scoring
- **Date Sorting**: Sort by creation date (newest/oldest)
- **Importance Sorting**: Sort by importance level
- **Type Sorting**: Sort by memory type

### 4. Contextual AI Suggestions
- **Date-Aware Suggestions**: Understands time references (tonight, tomorrow, etc.)
- **Contextual Clarification**: Asks for specific dates when needed
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Provides relevant suggestions when no exact matches found
- **Query Understanding**: Analyzes user intent and provides appropriate responses

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Search Logic
```python
# Multi-field search with flexible matching
search_conditions = Q()
search_conditions |= Q(content__icontains=query)
search_conditions |= Q(summary__icontains=query)
search_conditions |= Q(tags__contains=[query])
search_conditions |= Q(ai_reasoning__icontains=query)

# Word-by-word matching for better coverage
for word in query_words:
    if len(word) >= 2:
        search_conditions |= Q(content__icontains=word)
        search_conditions |= Q(summary__icontains=word)
        search_conditions |= Q(tags__contains=[word])
```

### AI-Powered Search
```python
# Try AI semantic search first
ai_results = chatgpt_service.search_memories(query, memory_data)
if ai_results:
    # Use AI results
    search_method = "ai_semantic"
else:
    # Fall back to enhanced basic search
    search_method = "enhanced_basic"
```

### Contextual Suggestions System
```python
def generate_contextual_suggestions(self, query: str, user_memories: List[Dict]) -> List[str]:
    """Generate contextual suggestions based on user query and memory context"""
    
    # Extract date/time context from query
    date_keywords = {
        'today': 'today',
        'tonight': 'today',
        'tomorrow': 'tomorrow', 
        'yesterday': 'yesterday',
        'this week': 'this week',
        'next week': 'next week'
    }
    
    # Check if query contains specific date references
    detected_date = None
    for keyword, date_type in date_keywords.items():
        if keyword in query_lower:
            detected_date = date_type
            break
    
    # If no specific date detected, ask for clarification
    if not detected_date and any(word in query_lower for word in ['plan', 'schedule', 'appointment']):
        return [
            "Could you specify which date you're asking about? (e.g., 'today', 'tomorrow', 'next week')",
            "I can help you find plans for a specific date. When are you looking for?",
            "To show you relevant memories, please mention a specific time period."
        ]
```

### Filter Combinations
```python
# Apply multiple filters
if memory_type:
    memories = memories.filter(memory_type=memory_type)
if importance:
    memories = memories.filter(importance__gte=int(importance))
if search_query:
    memories = memories.filter(search_conditions)
```

## Contextual AI Suggestions Feature

### Problem Solved
The original AI suggestion system had issues with date-related queries:
- **Issue**: When users asked "Did you set a reminder for tennis tonight at 9:00?", the AI would show irrelevant suggestions from days ago
- **Issue**: When users asked "I have plans for today", the AI would show random memories instead of asking for clarification

### Solution Implemented
1. **Date-Aware Processing**: The system now detects time references in queries
2. **Contextual Clarification**: When users mention plans without specific dates, the AI asks for clarification
3. **Relevant Suggestions**: For specific date queries, the AI provides suggestions related to that time period
4. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: When no contextual suggestions are available, the system falls back to recent memories

### Key Features
- **Time Reference Detection**: Recognizes "tonight", "tomorrow", "this week", "next week", etc.
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides date-specific suggestions and clarifications
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, helpful responses that guide users to better queries
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when AI is unavailable

### Example Interactions

**Query**: "Did you set a reminder for tennis tonight at 9:00?"
**Response**: 
- "Yes, you have a tennis match scheduled for tonight at 9:00 PM with John. Don't forget!"
- "Do you need any reminders set for other activities or events tonight?"

**Query**: "I have plans for today"
**Response**:
- "Could you specify which date you're asking about? (e.g., 'today', 'tomorrow', 'next week')"
- "I can help you find plans for a specific date. When are you looking for?"

**Query**: "What's my plan for tomorrow?"
**Response**:
- "You have a meeting with Sarah tomorrow at 2:00 PM to discuss the project. Are you prepared for it?"
- "You also have a dentist appointment tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Don't forget to bring your insurance card."
