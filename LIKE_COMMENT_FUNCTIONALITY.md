# Like and Comment Functionality for Shared Memories

## Overview

The Memora application now supports like and comment functionality for shared memories, allowing authenticated users to interact with memories shared with them based on their permissions. **Note: Like and comment interactions are only available for memories shared with the user, not for the user's own memories.**

## Features

### 1. Like/Reaction System
- **Multiple Reaction Types**: Users can react with 6 different emotions:
  - üëç Like
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è Love
  - üòÇ Funny
  - üòÆ Wow
  - üò¢ Sad
  - üò† Angry

- **Toggle Functionality**: Users can change their reaction or remove it entirely
- **Real-time Updates**: Like counts update instantly via AJAX
- **Visual Feedback**: Active reactions are highlighted with colored buttons

### 2. Comment System
- **Add Comments**: Users can add comments to memories they have permission to view
- **Comment Display**: Comments show user avatars, usernames, and timestamps
- **Form Validation**: Comments are validated for content and length
- **Real-time Count**: Comment counts update automatically

## Authentication and Permissions

### Memory Access Control
Users can only like and comment on memories they have permission to view based on:

1. **Memory Owner**: Always has full access
2. **Privacy Settings**:
   - **Private**: Only the owner can view
   - **Friends**: Only friends of the owner can view
   - **Organization**: Only organization members can view
   - **Public**: Anyone can view

3. **Direct Sharing**: Users can view memories specifically shared with them

### Permission Checks
- `memory.can_be_viewed_by(user)`: Checks if user can view the memory
- `memory.allow_likes`: Checks if likes are enabled for the memory
- `memory.allow_comments`: Checks if comments are enabled for the memory

## Implementation Details

### Models
- **MemoryLike**: Stores user reactions with reaction types
- **MemoryComment**: Stores user comments with timestamps
- **Memory**: Has `allow_likes` and `allow_comments` boolean fields

### Views
- **`toggle_like`**: Handles AJAX requests for like/reaction toggling
- **`add_comment`**: Handles comment submission via POST

### URLs
- `/memora/social/like/<memory_id>/`: Toggle like/reaction
- `/memora/social/comment/<memory_id>/`: Add comment

### Templates
- **Memory Detail**: Shows like buttons, comment form, and interaction history
- **Shared Memories**: Shows like/comment counts for shared memories

## User Experience

### For Memory Owners
- Can enable/disable likes and comments when creating/editing memories

- **Note: Memory owners cannot like or comment on their own memories**

### For Shared Memory Viewers
- Can react to memories they have permission to view
- Can add comments if comments are enabled
- See real-time updates of interaction counts
- Get visual feedback for their own interactions

## Security Features

1. **CSRF Protection**: All forms and AJAX requests include CSRF tokens
2. **Permission Validation**: Server-side checks ensure users can only interact with accessible memories
3. **Input Validation**: Comments are validated for content and length
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against spam interactions

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Features
- **AJAX Requests**: Real-time like/reaction updates without page refresh

- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for failed requests
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Database Design
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized for quick like/comment counts
- **Indexing**: Proper indexing on memory and user foreign keys
- **Cascade Deletion**: Comments and likes are removed when memories are deleted

## Usage Examples
