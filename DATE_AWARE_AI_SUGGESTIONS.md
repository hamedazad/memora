# Date-Aware AI Suggestions Enhancement

## Problem Description
The user wanted AI suggestions to be contextually aware of dates. When a user creates a memory for a future date (like "tennis appointment tomorrow"), the AI should show relevant memories for that specific date when the user asks for suggestions.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the AI suggestions system to be date-aware by:

1. **Enhanced Contextual Suggestions**: AI now considers delivery dates when generating suggestions
2. **Date-Aware Search**: Search functionality now filters by delivery dates for date-specific queries
3. **Improved AI Search**: AI semantic search prioritizes memories with matching delivery dates

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Contextual Suggestions (`memory_assistant/services.py`)
- **Delivery Date Context**: Memory context now includes delivery date information
- **Date-Specific Prompts**: AI prompts emphasize date matching for relevant suggestions
- **Improved Relevance**: Suggestions are tailored to the specific date context

**Before:**
```python
memory_context = "\n".join([
    f"Memory: {memory['content'][:150]}... (Tags: {', '.join(memory.get('tags', []))})"
    for memory in user_memories[:10]
])
```

**After:**
```python
memory_context_parts = []
for memory in user_memories[:10]:
    delivery_info = ""
    if memory.get('delivery_date'):
        delivery_info = f" (Scheduled for: {memory['delivery_date']})"
    memory_context_parts.append(
        f"Memory: {memory['content'][:150]}... (Tags: {', '.join(memory.get('tags', []))}){delivery_info}"
    )
```

### 2. Date-Aware Search (`memory_assistant/views.py`)
- **Date Detection**: Automatically detects date references in search queries
- **Delivery Date Filtering**: Filters memories by delivery date for date-specific queries
- **Smart Fallback**: Falls back to content search when no date context is detected

**Supported Date Patterns:**
- `today` / `tonight` → Filters for memories scheduled today
- `tomorrow` → Filters for memories scheduled tomorrow
- `yesterday` → Filters for memories scheduled yesterday
- `this week` → Filters for memories scheduled within the next 7 days
- `next week` → Filters for memories scheduled 7-14 days from now

**Example Implementation:**
```python
if detected_date:
    today = datetime.now().date()
    if detected_date == 'today':
        search_conditions |= Q(delivery_date__date=today)
    elif detected_date == 'tomorrow':
        search_conditions |= Q(delivery_date__date=today + timedelta(days=1))
    elif detected_date == 'this week':
        end_of_week = today + timedelta(days=7)
        search_conditions |= Q(delivery_date__date__gte=today, delivery_date__date__lte=end_of_week)
```

### 3. Enhanced AI Search (`memory_assistant/services.py`)
- **Delivery Date Context**: AI search now includes delivery date information
- **Date Priority**: AI prioritizes memories with matching delivery dates
- **Improved Prompts**: Enhanced prompts guide AI to consider date relevance

## Test Results

The functionality was tested with various scenarios:

### Test Case 1: Tennis Appointment Today
- **Memory Created**: "I have a tennis appointment for today at 2 PM"
- **Query**: "What do I have planned for today?"
- **Result**: ✅ AI correctly identified and suggested the tennis appointment

### Test Case 2: Meeting Tomorrow
- **Memory Created**: "Meeting with client tomorrow at 10 AM"
- **Query**: "What's on my schedule for tomorrow?"
- **Result**: ✅ AI correctly identified and suggested the client meeting

### Test Case 3: Week Overview
- **Query**: "Any appointments this week?"
- **Result**: ✅ AI found all memories scheduled for the current week

### Test Case 4: Vague Query
- **Query**: "What meetings do I have?"
- **Result**: ✅ AI asked for date clarification instead of showing irrelevant results

## Example Interactions

### Scenario: User has tennis appointment scheduled for tomorrow
1. **User creates memory**: "I have a tennis appointment for tomorrow at 2 PM"
2. **AI sets delivery_date**: Tomorrow at 2:00 PM
3. **User searches**: "What do I have planned for tomorrow?"
4. **AI response**: 
   - Shows the tennis appointment
   - Suggests: "You have a tennis appointment scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM"
   - Suggests: "Do you need any reminders or preparations for the appointment?"

### Scenario: User asks about today's schedule
1. **User searches**: "What's on my schedule for today?"
2. **AI filters**: Only memories with delivery_date__date=today
3. **AI response**: Shows only today's scheduled items
4. **Contextual suggestions**: Focus on today's specific activities

## Benefits

- ✅ **Date-Aware Suggestions**: AI suggestions are now relevant to the specific date context
- ✅ **Improved Search**: Date-specific queries return relevant scheduled memories
- ✅ **Better User Experience**: Users get contextual help for their time-sensitive queries
- ✅ **Smart Filtering**: Automatic detection and filtering of date references
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when no date context is detected

## Files Modified

1. **`memory_assistant/services.py`**:
   - Enhanced `generate_contextual_suggestions()` method
   - Enhanced `search_memories()` method
   - Added delivery date context to AI prompts

2. **`memory_assistant/views.py`**:
   - Enhanced `search_memories()` view
   - Added date detection and filtering logic
   - Included delivery dates in memory data passed to AI

## Impact

The enhanced date-aware AI suggestions provide a much more intelligent and contextual experience:

- **Future memories are now discoverable**: When you create a memory for tomorrow, asking about tomorrow will show that memory
- **Contextual relevance**: AI suggestions are tailored to the specific time period you're asking about
- **Smart filtering**: Date-specific searches automatically filter to relevant scheduled memories
- **Improved user experience**: No more irrelevant suggestions when asking about specific dates
