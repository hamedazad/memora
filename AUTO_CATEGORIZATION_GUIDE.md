## How It Works

### Text Memories
When you create a text memory:
1. Enter your memory content
2. The AI analyzes the content
3. Automatically assigns the most appropriate category
4. Generates relevant tags and summary
5. Suggests an importance level (1-10)

### Audio Memories
When you create an audio memory:
1. Speak your memory or provide transcribed text
2. The AI processes the audio content
3. Automatically categorizes based on context
4. Generates tags, summary, and importance level
5. Creates the memory with full categorization

## AI Confidence

The system provides a confidence score (0-100%) for each categorization:
- **90-100%**: High confidence in the category assignment
- **70-89%**: Good confidence with some uncertainty
- **50-69%**: Moderate confidence, may need review
- **Below 50%**: Low confidence, manual review recommended

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Organization**: No need to manually categorize every memory
2. **Consistent Categorization**: AI applies consistent logic across all memories
3. **Better Search**: Find memories by category more easily
4. **Insights**: Understand patterns in your memory types
5. **Time Saving**: Focus on content, not organization

## Manual Override

You can always:
- Change the category after creation
- Edit tags and summary
- Adjust importance levels
- The AI suggestions are just starting points

## Examples

- Category: Work
- Confidence: 90%
- Tags: ["meeting", "project", "deadline"]
