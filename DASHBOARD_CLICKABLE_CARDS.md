# Dashboard Clickable Cards Feature

## Overview
The dashboard now features clickable statistics cards that allow users to quickly navigate to filtered memory views. Each card shows a count and provides a direct link to view the corresponding memories.

## Features Added

### 1. Clickable Statistics Cards
- **Total Memories Card**: Shows total count and links to all memories
- **Important Memories Card**: Shows count of memories with importance >= 8 and links to important memories
- **Scheduled Memories Card**: Shows count of memories with delivery dates and links to scheduled memories
- **Today's Memories Card**: Shows count of memories scheduled for today and links to today's memories

### 2. New Filtered Memory Views
- `/memories/all/` - View all memories with search and sorting
- `/memories/important/` - View important memories (importance >= 8)
- `/memories/scheduled/` - View all scheduled memories
- `/memories/today/` - View memories scheduled for today

### 3. Enhanced Filtered Memory Template
- Search functionality within filtered views
- Sorting options (newest, oldest, most/least important, delivery date)
- Pagination for large memory collections
- Responsive grid layout
- Clear navigation back to dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### New Views Added
- `important_memories()` - Filters memories by importance >= 8
- `scheduled_memories()` - Shows memories with delivery dates
- `todays_memories()` - Shows memories scheduled for today
- `all_memories()` - Alternative view for all memories

### New URLs
```python
path('memories/all/', views.all_memories, name='all_memories'),
path('memories/important/', views.important_memories, name='important_memories'),
path('memories/scheduled/', views.scheduled_memories, name='scheduled_memories'),
path('memories/today/', views.todays_memories, name='todays_memories'),
```

### Template Changes
- Updated `dashboard.html` to make cards clickable with links
- Added `filtered_memories.html` template for consistent filtered views
- Enhanced CSS for hover effects on clickable cards

### Dashboard Updates
- Added scheduled and today's memory counts to dashboard context
- Changed layout from 3 cards to 4 cards (col-md-3 instead of col-md-4)
- Added visual indicators that cards are clickable

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Quick Navigation**: Users can click directly on dashboard cards to see relevant memories
2. **Visual Feedback**: Cards have hover effects to indicate they're clickable
3. **Consistent Interface**: All filtered views use the same template with search and sorting
4. **Clear Context**: Each filtered view shows the filter type and count in the header
5. **Easy Return**: All filtered views have a "Back to Dashboard" button

- Click "Total Memories" card → View all memories with search and sorting
- Click "Important Memories" card → View only high-importance memories

- Click "Today's Memories" card → View memories scheduled for today

## Future Enhancements
