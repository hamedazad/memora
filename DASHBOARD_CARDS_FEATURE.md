# Dashboard Cards Feature

## Overview
The dashboard now features clickable statistics cards that allow users to view detailed filtered lists of memories based on different categories.

## Features

### Clickable Statistics Cards
The dashboard displays four main statistics cards:
1. **Total Memories** - Shows the total count of all memories
2. **Important Memories** - Shows memories with importance â‰¥ 8
3. **Scheduled Memories** - Shows all memories with scheduled dates
4. **Today's Memories** - Shows memories scheduled for today

### Interactive Elements
