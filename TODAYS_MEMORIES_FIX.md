# Today's Memories Functionality Fix

## Problem Description
The user reported that when they create a memory saying "I have a tennis appointment for today", the memory should belong to today, but tomorrow it will not show up in the "Today's Memories" section.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the date filtering logic in two places:

1. **Dashboard View** (`memory_assistant/views.py` line 30):
   ```python
   # BROKEN: Comparing DateTimeField with date object
   todays_memories_count = memories.filter(delivery_date=datetime.now().date()).count()
   ```

2. **Today's Memories View** (`memory_assistant/views.py` line 1150):
   ```python
   # BROKEN: Comparing DateTimeField with date object
   memories = Memory.objects.filter(
       user=request.user, 
       is_archived=False,
       delivery_date=today  # This was comparing DateTimeField with date
   )
   ```

## The Fix
The problem was that `delivery_date` is a `DateTimeField` (stores both date and time), but we were comparing it with a `date` object (only date). In Django, this comparison doesn't work as expected.

### Solution
Use Django's `__date` lookup to compare only the date part of the datetime field:

1. **Dashboard View Fix**:
   ```python
   # FIXED: Using __date lookup
   todays_memories_count = memories.filter(delivery_date__date=datetime.now().date()).count()
   ```

2. **Today's Memories View Fix**:
   ```python
   # FIXED: Using __date lookup
   memories = Memory.objects.filter(
       user=request.user, 
       is_archived=False,
       delivery_date__date=today  # Now correctly compares date parts
   )
   ```

## How It Works
- When a user creates a memory with "today" in the content, the AI date parsing sets `delivery_date` to today's date with a specific time (e.g., "2025-08-08 14:00:00+00:00")
- The `delivery_date__date` lookup extracts only the date part from the datetime field for comparison
- This ensures that memories scheduled for today (regardless of the specific time) will show up in "Today's Memories"

## Test Results
The fix was tested with the following scenario:
- Created a memory: "I have a tennis appointment for today at 2 PM"
- AI correctly set delivery_date to today at 2:00 PM
- The memory now appears in "Today's Memories" when using `delivery_date__date=today`
- The memory does NOT appear when using the old method `delivery_date=today`

## Files Modified
- `memory_assistant/views.py` - Fixed date filtering in dashboard and todays_memories views

## Impact
- ✅ Memories with "today" references now correctly appear in "Today's Memories"
- ✅ Dashboard count for today's memories is now accurate
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains timezone awareness and proper datetime handling
